Hi there! I am Sathvik Swaminathan, a 4th year undergraduate student double majoring in Physics and Electronics and Communication Engineering at BITS Pilani.

My areas of interests encompasses Computer Systems and ASIC Design, with a research emphasis on designing high performance and secure systems!

I'll be joining NVIDIA as an ASIC Design Intern and am currently interning at the Processor Architecture Research Lab (PAR-L) at Intel!

In the past, I've worked with [Professor Dominique Devriese](https://soft.vub.ac.be/~dodevrie/) (KU Leuven) on developing a secure compilation scheme based on capabilities, and [Professor Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) (IIT Bombay) on developing a page fault based covert channel.  

If you are looking to collaborate or would like to have a chat, please reach out to me through [mail](mailto:sathvikswaminathan@gmail.com).

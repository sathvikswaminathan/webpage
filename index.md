Hi there! I am Sathvik Swaminathan, a 4th year undergraduate student double majoring in Physics and Electronics and Communication Engineering at BITS Pilani.

My research interests lies in the general area of Computer Systems, with a particular emphasis on Security. To that end, I am currently working with [Professor Dominique Devriese](https://soft.vub.ac.be/~dodevrie/) (KU Leuven) on developing a secure compilation scheme. In the past, I have worked with [Professor Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) (IIT Bombay) on developing a timerless covert channel.  

If you are looking to collaborate or would like to have a chat, please reach out to me through [mail](mailto:sathvikswaminathan@gmail.com).
